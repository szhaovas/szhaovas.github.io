Always been a fan of tokyo jihen!

I have recently gotten into guitar, so I thought I'd start with one of their Bossa-esque songs.

This tab version has been vastly simplified such that even guitar noobs such as myself can play:
- standard tuning (E/A/D/G/B/E).
- all chords can be played by barring the index finger and moving the other fingers no more than 3 frets down. i.e. no need for big hand shape changes.
- made with Musescore. File can be found [here]({{site.url}}/resource/keshou_naoshi.mscz) (if you want to hear what it sounds like).
- great for singing along!
